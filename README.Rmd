# totERP

This package is an R data package for a TOT ERP study (currently under review).

Within this package are the raw behavioral data, processing and analysis scripts (in the form of vignettes), and processed data. 

Because of file size limitations, some data objects (such as the raw EEG data and single-trial preprocessed master ERP data file) could not be included in this repository. We are working on hosting these on Open Science Framework. In the meantime, please email pab2163@columbia.edu if you would like access to any data files in the meantime.
